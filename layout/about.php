			<p>The goal of the Digital US South Initiative is to combine rigorous scholarship and new technologies in ways that will promote and enhance thoughtful engagement with the South’s history, cultures, and landscapes. These projects are designed with both scholar and non-scholar in mind and provide opportunities for classroom teaching, new scholarly production, and individual study and enjoyment. Currently, DUSS federates twelve projects, with topics as diverse as agriculture, 19th-century literature, natural history, the Civil War, and the Civil Rights Movement. These projects have benefited from the generous financial support of the University of South Carolina’s College of Arts and Sciences, University Libraries, USC's Center for Digital Humanities, the Watson-Brown Foundation, and the Humanities Council<sup>SC</sup>.</p>
